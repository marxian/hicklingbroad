<p class="default"><b><br>1.<a name="1"> RULES</a></b></p>
<p class="default">Racing will take place under the current racing rules of sailing 2009-2012 (RRS), the prescriptions of the RYA, these sailing instructions, and, when relevant, the appropriate class rules. <i>RRS rule 45 shall NOT apply (RRS rule 45 : A boat shall be afloat and off moorings at her preparatory signal).</i></p>

<p class="default">For further information on the RYA rules see: <b>www.rya.org.uk</b><br></p>

<p class="default"><b>2. <a name="2"> CONDITIONS OF ENTRY</a></b></p>
<p class="default">(a) The safety of a boat and her entire management including insurance shall be the sole responsibility of the owner/competitor racing the boat who must ensure that the boat and crew are adequate to face the conditions that may arise in the course of the race. Neither the establishment of these sailing instructions nor the inspection of the boat under these conditions in any  way limits or reduces the absolute responsibility of the owner/competitor for his crew, his boat and the management thereof. The race organisers shall not be responsible for any loss, damage, death, or personal injury howsoever caused to the owner/competitor, his skipper or crew, as a result of their taking part in the race or races. Moreover every owner/competitor warrants the suitability of his boat for the race or races. 
<br><br>(b) For Open Class meetings, valid certificates must be available for inspection. Boats may also be subject to examination.
<br><br>(c) Boats must be entered at the clubhouse before the warning signal for their race is made.</p>

<p class="default"><b>3.<a name="3"> SAFETY</a></b></p>
<p class="default">Personal flotation device. - Junior members and children under the age of 12 shall wear an adequate personal flotation device whilst afloat. Each competitor is individually responsible for wearing a personal flotation device adequate for the conditions. Wet suits or dry suits do not constitute adequate personal flotation devices.</p>
<p class="default">Rescue Facilities - A powered rescue craft shall be on stand-by during all official club activities.</p>

<p class="default"><b>4.<a name="4"> COMMUNICATIONS WITH COMPETITORS</a></b></p>
<p class="default">Flag signals in accordance with RRS will be used for warning, preparatory, and starting signals and attention will be drawn to them by audible signals from the clubhouse or committee boat.</p>

<p class="default"><b>5.<a name="5"> COURSE INSTRUCTIONS</a></b></p>
<p class="default">Numbered or lettered buoys mark the course. All other stakes etc., are not part of the course. Buoys numbered 1 to 5 are laid in established positions on the Broad as shown on the map in the clubhouse. Additional buoys may be laid to ensure that courses with windward legs may be set, or for other reasons. These buoys will be selected from W or 6. The approximate position of these marks, when in use,  will also be shown on the map in the clubhouse. The direction of start, the number of rounds to be sailed and the order in which buoys are to be rounded, [reading from left to right] will be displayed on the clubhouse. The colour of the board on which the buoy number is painted indicates the side on  which that buoy is to be rounded.</p>

<p class="default"><b>6. <a name="6">STARTING TIMES</a></b></p>
<p class="default">Starting times of races will be displayed on a notice board in the clubhouse. All starting times after the start of the first race or series of races will be approximate. Signals shall be made at 3 minute intervals. Signals shall be warning : class flag and 1 sound, preparatory : flag P and 1 sound, starting : flags removed and 1 sound.  This varies RRS 26. A bell shall be used at the clubhouse as a sound signal approximately 5 minutes before the start of the next series.</p>

<p class="default"><b>7. <a name="7">FIXED LINE STARTS: CLUBHOUSE LINE</a> </b> </p>
<p class="default">The starting line will be taken as the transit formed by the red and white staff surmounted by a triangle at the waters edge of the club site, and the white staff surmounted by a disc on the balcony in front of the Clubhouse. All starts shall be made between the Inner and Outer distance markers which are white buoys with yellow flags.</p>

<p class="default"><b>8. <a name="8">FIXED LINE STARTS: COMMITTEE BOAT</a> </b> </p>
<p class="default">An orange flag flown at the clubhouse will signify that a committee boat starting line will be used for the next series of starts. Two sound signals will be made when this flag is broken out. The starting line will be a line between the mast of the committee boat the outer orange buoy with a yellow flag. An extra buoy ( orange with a yellow flag ) will be laid as a limit mark adjacent to the committee boat. No boat shall pass between this limit mark and the committee boat, any such boat will be liable to disqualification.
<br><br>The course details and number of rounds will be displayed on the clubhouse as in SI 5. An X on the course board denotes the position of the starting line in relation to the rest of the course. The buoy number to the right of the X will be the first mark of the course following the start, after which the course sailed will be as displayed, ignoring the X on subsequent rounds. The position of the starting line will also be indicated on the map in the clubhouse. A bell may be used at the clubhouse as a sound signal approximately 10 minutes before the start of the next series. </p>

<p class="default"><b>9. <a name="9">START LINE: EXCLUSION ZONE</a></b></p>
<p class="default">A start line exclusion zone will be used at the discretion of the Race Officer. All competitors will be briefed on its use prior to the start of the days race programme. The rectangular zone is defined by the inner and outer distance marks of the start line, and two pole buoys displaying orange flags positioned some 30 to 40 metres on the pre-start side of the start line. Competitors may not sail in the zone until the preparatory flag for their class is displayed.<br>Breaches of this instruction will not be grounds for protest by a boat, judge, or race committee.</p>
 
<p class="default"><b>10. <a name="10">RECALLS</a></b></p>
<p class="default"><b>Individual recalls</b> - When at her starting signal any part of a boat's hull, crew or equipment is on the course side of the starting line, the boat shall sail completely to the pre-start side of the line before starting. In the event of a boat or boats being over the line at the start, an audible signal will be made once and the flag X will be displayed until all such boats are completely on the pre-start side of the starting line, or until 2 minutes has elapsed, whichever is the earlier. </p>
<p class="default"><b>General recall</b> - If there are a number of unidentified boats failing to start correctly or there is an error in starting procedure, a general recall may be signalled by displaying the First Substitute flag and by making two audible signals. The class flag of the class being recalled will remain flying and the preparatory signal (Code flag P) together with the warning signals (class flags) for any following starts will be lowered.
<br><br>After two minutes the First Substitute flag will be lowered and one sound signal made.
<br><br>One minute later the preparatory signal (Code flag P) for the recalled class will be made together with the warning signal (class flag) of the next class in the series if necessary. The start for the recalled class will then take place exactly three minutes later.
<br><br>Note: The above procedure means that, as a result of the general recall, the start of the recalled class and any subsequent starts in the series will be delayed by exactly six minutes. </p>

<p class="default"><b>11. <a name="11">FINISHING LINE: CLUBHOUSE LINE</a> </b> </p>
<p class="default">The finishing line is as defined in SI 7, between the inner and outer distance marks. A round is completed each time a boat crosses the transit for the finishing line in the direction indicated by the arrow on the course board. </p>

<p class="default"><b>12. <a name="12">FINISH LINE: COMMITTEE BOAT</a> </b> </p>
<p class="default">If a committee boat finish is to be used, this will be indicated on the courseboard. The finishing line will be between the mast of the Committee boat and the outer orange buoy with a yellow flag. Boats must finish in the same direction as the start. When a committee boat finish is used then a round is completed each time a boat crosses the extension of the finishing line, in the direction to finish, on the leg containing X. </p>

<p class="default"><b>13. <a name="13">FINISHING: AVERAGE LAP METHOD</a> </b> </p>
<p class="default">When Flag U is displayed and two audible signals are made, complete the lap and finish in the direction of the arrow from the last mark of the course, at the end of a complete lap. As defined in SI 10. </p>

<p class="default"><b>14. <a name="14">TOUCHING A MARK</a></b> </p>
<p class="default">RRS rule 31 shall apply (After getting well clear of other boats as soon as possible, take a penalty by promptly making one complete 360 degree turn including one tack and one gybe).</p>

<p class="default"><b>15. <a name="15">ALTERNATIVE PENALTIES FOR AN INFRINGEMENT OF A RULE OF PART 2</a></b></p>
<p class="default">RRS rule 44 shall apply (After getting well clear of the other boats as soon after the incident as possible, a boat takes a 720 degree turns penalty by promptly making two complete 360 degree turns in the same direction, including two tacks and two gybes). The scoring penalty RRS 44.3 shall not apply.</p>

<p class="default"><b>16. <a name="16">SHORTENING THE COURSE AFTER THE START</a></b></p>
<p class="default">RRS rule 32 is changed. The race committee may shorten the course at any time it sees fit. The meaning of flag S is changed. It means the course is shortened. This will be signalled at any mark rounding, before the lead boat has begun the next leg, by displaying flag S together with the class flag and making two sound signals. That mark will be the last mark of the course. All boats in the class whose course has been shortened are to pass that mark on the required side and then sail straight to the finish line and finish.</p>

<p class="default"><b>17. <a name="17">PROTESTS</a></b> </p>
<p class="default">Protests shall be made in accordance with RRS rules and handed in within 30 minutes after the last boat in the race finishes. The protest will be heard as soon as possible. The quorum of the protest committee shall be three persons. Protest forms may be obtained from the starting box.</p>

<p class="default"><b>18. <a name="18">SCORING SYSTEM</a></b></p>
<p class="default">The low point scoring system, RRS A2 shall apply. Points will be awarded to the combination of boat and helm; this varies RRS A2. (The winning boat/helmsman in each race of a points series will score 1 point, the second 2 points, and the others finishing the same number of points as their position. A starter who does not finish, who retires through an infringement of the rules, or who is disqualified will receive points that are one more than the number of starters in that race. A boat/helmsman that did not come to the starting area will receive points one more than the number of  boats entered.<br><br>
For Regattas and Open Events, a boat/helmsman that did not start, retired after finishing, did not finish or was disqualified will receive points for that race equal to one point more than the number of boats entered in the series. In the event of a tie in a points series the tie shall be broken in favour of the boat/helmsman with the most first places, or, if the tie remains, the most second places, or lower places if necessary, using only the scores for each boat that count for her series, followed if necessary by the last race procedure.)</p>
<p class="default">Special instructions for Club points series days.<br>
(a) For races of less than three starters the following points will be awarded for finishing the race; one starter- 3 points; 2 starters- first 2 points, second 3 points, a boat/helmsman that did not finish shall be scored 4 points. A boat/helmsman disqualified shall not count the race as a qualifying race for the series.<br>
(b) Where a class race has only one entry, the boat/helmsman may race in the appropriate All-Comers race, for which a corrected time will be given, and three points will be awarded to the class race as in (a) above.</p>

<p class="default"><b>19. <a name="19"><a href="pdf/handicaps.pdf">HANDICAPS</a></a></b></p>
<p class="default">The RYA Portsmouth Yardstick Scheme will be used. Portsmouth Numbers will be as published in the current edition of the RYA Portsmouth Yardstick Book (YR2). In the absence of a published handicap in YR2, a Trial Number will be allocated by the Sailing Sub-Committee, based where available on the Portsmouth Number allocated by the relevant Class Association or the Number in common use on the Broads as published in the current NSBA Green Book. The Sailing Sub Committee will on completion of a qualifying number of races in a series either confirm that number as a Club Number or adjust it to suit local circumstances and conditions. That decision will be based on the analysis of the results of the qualifying number of races using the RYA Portsmouth Yardstick Scheme. Any Portsmouth Number issued by the Sailing Sub Committee shall be at its sole discretion and its decision shall be final. A boat which competes using a Trial Number will not be eligible for the award of a Club trophy. All-Comers A are defined as boats with numbers of 1078 and under. All-Comers B as boats with numbers of 1079 to 1174, and All-Comers C as boats with numbers of 1175 and over. Class dinghies which do not comply with the rules of their class relating to the number of crew to be carried shall have penalty of 25 subtracted from their Portsmouth Number.</p>

<p class="default"><b>20. <a name="20">CLASS CHAMPIONSHIPS</a></b></p>
<p class="default">Class championships will be held for classes selected at the discretion of the Sailing Sub Committee. They will be full season trophy series running from the start of the Spring Series to the end of the Autumn Series and will be based on the places achieved, within class, in All-Comers Race 2.<br>
In each class all helmsmen start with zero points and the helmsman with the highest score after the last race is the winner. In the event of a tie at the end of a series the result of the last race will be used to decide the winner.<br>
The predetermined number to be used for scoring each class will relate to the predicted average number of starters and will be set by the Sailing Sub Committee prior to the start of the seasons racing. Each helmsman will be awarded one point for every race he starts plus one point for every other helmsman he beats who started the race within the predetermined number of points below him or any number of points above him.</p>
