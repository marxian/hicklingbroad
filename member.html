New fees are set at the AGM each autumn.</i></p>

<p class="twelve">
We hope that you will find the waters of Hickling Broad and beyond to your liking
- there are many areas to explore. As well as cruising activities,
which are very much left up to the individual members, we have a
vibrant racing fraternity. In many ways it is the racing which makes the
club, it develops peoples' sailing skills, teaches them the
rules regarding rights of way and helps to create a responsible rather
than a casual approach to sailing. We always welcome new 'racers' so please feel free to
join in any of our racing activities.</p>
<p class="twelve">
The Club is run on a voluntary basis by the members. We will therefore
ask for your help, wherever possible, with the various tasks during the
sailing season. This will be explained in more detail at your
introductory meeting. </p>
<p class="twelve">
When you apply for membership of the Club, you are agreeing to abide by
the Club Rules which are set out in the handbook. We would ask that you
pay particular attention to the following:</p>
<ol type="1" class="default">
<li class="default">All sailing dinghies and tenders must be berthed only on the berths allocated to them. No other type of boat or craft shall be allowed on the berths or the Club site.</li><br>
<li class="default">All Sailing dinghies must be insured for a minimum of £500,000 in respect of third party risks.</li><br>
<li class="default">Members who do not occupy their berths before 31st May must notify the Berthing Master by 7th June stating the reason. If this notification does not take place, the berth will be re-allocated by the Berthing Master and a proportion of the berthing fee will be refunded.</li><br>
<li class="default">When a member ceases to park his boat on the berth allocated to it, the Berthing Master must be informed so that the berth can be re-allocated to a member on the waiting list. A rebate will be given in such circumstances. It would also help if members who are likely to have their berths vacant for any period, even if only for two or three weeks, would inform the Berthing Master of the vacant dates. This would enable members awaiting a berth to be given permission to use them for the odd week or two.</li><br>
<li class="default">To avoid inconvenience to others at and around the launching slips, members are requested to return their trailers and launching trolleys to their berths immediately after launching their boats.</li><br>
<li class="default">We regret that no road trailer can be left on the Club site unless it is used to carry the owner's boat on its allocated berth.</li><br>
<li class="default">Members of the Club, their guests and visitors, may use the Club premises and any other facilities of the Club, entirely at their own risk and impliedly accept that: </font></li>
<p class="default">I. The Club will not accept any liability for any damage or loss of property belonging to members, their guests or visitors to the Club.</p>
<p class="default">II. The Club will not accept any liability for personal injury arising out of the use of the Club premises, or any other facilities of the Club, or out of participation in any race organised by the Club whether or not such damage or injury could have been attributed to or was occasioned by the neglect, default or negligence of any of the Officers, Committee or servants of the Club.</p>
<p class="default">III. Before inviting any guests or visitors onto the premises or to participate in events organised by the Club, members will draw their attention to this rule.</p>
<p class="default">IV. Parents and guardians are warned that the Club is only able to provide rescue facilities during the hours of Club racing. Outside these hours, parents and guardians have sole responsibility for their children and wards and must appreciate that the Club cannot be expected to exercise supervision or control. Even during Club racing, the Club cannot accept responsibility for children, or any other persons, not engaged in Club racing. Children under the age of 12 years shall at all times wear adequate personal buoyancy whilst on the Club site. (Club Rule 24).</p>
<li class="default">The safety of a boat and her entire management, including insurance, shall be the sole responsibility of the owner/competitor racing the boat who must ensure that the boat and crew are adequate to face the conditions that may arise in the course of a race. Neither the establishment of these sailing instructions, nor the inspection of the boat under these conditions in any way limits or reduces the absolute responsibility of the owner/competitor for his crew, his boat and the management thereof. The race organisers shall not be responsible for any loss, damage, death or personal injury howsoever caused to the owner/competitor, his skipper or crew, as a result of their taking part in the race or races. Moreover every owner/competitor warrants the suitability of his boat for the race or races.(Sailing Instruction 2).</li>
